<li>IBM Research defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) as Augmented Intelligence, helping experts scale their capabilities as machines do the time-consuming work.</li>
<li>AI learns by creating machine learning models based on provided inputs and desired outputs.</li>
<li>AI can be described in different ways based on strength, breadth, and application - Weak or Narrow AI, Strong or Generalized AI, Super or Conscious AI.</li>
<li>AI is the fusion of many fields of study, such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Psychology, Linguistics, and Philosophy.</li>
