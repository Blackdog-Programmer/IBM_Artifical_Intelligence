# Week 1 - What is AI?
[AI is Not Magic: Itâ€™s Time to Demystify and Apply](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2019/03/ai-is-not-magic/)

<uo>
<li>IBM Research defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) as Augmented Intelligence, helping experts scale their capabilities as machines do the time-consuming work.</li>
<li>AI learns by creating machine learning models based on provided inputs and desired outputs.</li>
<li>AI can be described in different ways based on strength, breadth, and application - Weak or Narrow AI, Strong or Generalized AI, Super or Conscious AI.</li>
<li>AI is the fusion of many fields of study, such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Psychology, Linguistics, and Philosophy.</li>

# Week 2 - Cognitive computing systems

<uo>
  <li>Read and interpret unstructured data, understanding not just the meaning of words but also the intent and context in which they are used.</li>
  <li>Reason about problems in a way that humans reason and make decisions.</li>
  <li>Learn over time from their interactions with humans and keep getting smarter.</li>
